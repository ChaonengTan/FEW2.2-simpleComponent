      <p>The input range below looks like a single element 
        in the DOM. In the browser the it looks like a 
        bar/track with a circle/thumb that moves along the 
        bar. If you were going to make this yourself you'd 
        have to make these elements along with a container.

      <!-- Range Example - Shadow DOM -->
      <input type="range">

      <p>Inspect the input in the browser. Then turn on 
        the show Shadow Elements option.
